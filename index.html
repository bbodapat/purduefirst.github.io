		<h1>Leadership Class</h1>
		<hr class="medium-hr">
		<br />
		<p>Our FIRST Leadership class promotes and develops leadership skills for college students in an engaging, hands-on way. We have various team building activities that highlight the challenges of working in a group but also the benefits of having an effective leader. We have professors from departments across Purdue come to class and speak on what it means to be a leader to them. The professors share their wealth of knowledge and encourage us to continue to mentor and engage students in STEM.</p>

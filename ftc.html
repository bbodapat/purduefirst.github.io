		<br />
		<p>Machines of Mayhem, FTC 10133, was created in August of 2015 at New Community School, a school in Lafayette, Indiana.  They have three seventh graders and one eighth grader on the team.  This year they had a lot of help to be all that they are. They are mentored by the students of another local FIRST Team, FRC 1747; local FRC mentors; and PFP's own mentors.</p>

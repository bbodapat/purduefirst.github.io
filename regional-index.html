		<p>The Purdue Regional is an Indiana FIRST Regional Event. FIRST (For Inspiration and Recognition of Science and Technology) is a multinational organization that aspires to change the way students see engineering, science, and technology. The FIRST Robotics Competition challenges teams of young people and their mentors to solve a common problem in a six-week timeframe using a standard “kit of parts” and a common set of rules. Teams made up of high school students, teachers, engineers, and other mentors build robots from the parts and compete with other teams around the world.</p>
		<p>FIRST was founded in 1989 by Dean Kamen, inventor of the Segway Human Transporter, and in 1992 the inaugural FIRST competition was held with 28 teams. 15 years later, it has grown to over 1000 teams. FIRST extends this concept by inspiring youth 9-14 years old in the FIRST LEGO League. For more information, please visit the FIRST Website.</p>
